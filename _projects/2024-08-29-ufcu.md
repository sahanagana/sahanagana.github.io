This past summer I was able to intern at UFCU as a software engineering intern for the IT department.

### What I did
My main project was working on a web application to streamline the process of filling out WSUD forms. I learned a lot about backend development via Django and MSSQL.
I also created some python scripts to automate stuff.
I refactored code and updated outdated scripts.

### What I learned

I realized you can kind of just reach out to people when you want to.
This was how I met with people on the security team.
