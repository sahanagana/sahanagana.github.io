My first experience with open source software was in high school, though I was unaware of it at the time. 
I took a cybersecurity class that was newly set up by my very passionate high school CS teacher.
In it, we used Kali machines to learn about bash and different tools. Despite this, I was not aware what open-source meant; I discovered this only in college.  

Switching to Linux, utilizing open source software

Even though I was heavily utilizing open source software, I still thought it was too complicated for me.
fancy shmancy developer stuff

I talked to a friend on it, he said it was an assignment for a class. I figured if the average college student can do it, so can I.
I found a tutorial github (LINK) and followed the steps to learn about pull requests. This was something that I was unfamiliar with despite having experience with git.

I found a site (LINK) that scraped for open issues.

I realized a lot of places had minor issues that they needed fixed, where the main developer team simply didn't have time to focus on such a small issue.
After combing through a couple projects, I ended up finding [REPO](LINK).
