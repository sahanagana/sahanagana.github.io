<definition of imposter syndome>. It's typically played as a bad thing.
There's a part of me that wants to play devil's advocate, however: is this always negative? Does it have to be?

I felt imposter syndrome.
If I was in a place where I didn't feel it, would that be the right place for me?

Something to chew on.
